AmpFriend
=========

A handy utility to assist in doing regular tube amp related maintenance.

Amp Friend is a quick 'n dirty application I have created for personal use. At present, it is ugly as hell, and probably buggy.
It also lacks many features. I've put it on Github to help inspire myself to do more to the tool, so that it someday might be useful
for other technicians out there.

The application is writen in **C#**, and I use SharpDevelop, but it will also work as a Visual Studio project, if that's your thing.
I can't see any reason why it wouldn't run under Mono, either.
